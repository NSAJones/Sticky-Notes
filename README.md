# Sticky Note Application for CoGrammar
## Setup
Download required modules from `requirements.txt` using pip and then launch the server using `runserver.bat`. I would highly recommend starting a venv environment. If you want to run the server manually, the manage file is at `sticky_notes/manage.py`. Example commands for setup below
```
> python -m venv
> venv\Scripts\activate.bat
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> runserver.bat
```
